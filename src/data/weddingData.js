        story: `From Classroom Companions to Soulmates
                Siphesihle and Sanele’s journey began at Lyndhurst Primary School, 
                where they first crossed paths as young learners. In Grade 7, back in 2009, 
                they found themselves in the same classroom—and soon, a beautiful friendship began to blossom.

                But as seasons changed, so did their paths.They parted ways at the end of that school year, 
                each attending different high schools and walking separate journeys for nearly a decade.Yet even then, 
                God was at work behind the scenes, weaving a story only He could author. 

                In 2019, their paths crossed once more—this time through Sanele’s childhood friend and spiritual sister.
                That reunion sparked something deeper, something lasting.What began as a rekindled friendship soon grew into: 
                a love rooted in shared memories, laughter, and the quiet certainty of God’s timing. 

                “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him…” — Romans 8: 28 

                Their love grew not by chance, but by grace.Through prayer, patience, and purpose, they discovered that what 
                God joins together, no distance or delay can separate.
                “Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” — Mark 10: 9 

                Now, years later, Siphesihle and Sanele are writing a new chapter—hand in hand, 
                heart to heart, under heaven’s blessing.Their story is a testimony of divine orchestration, 
                and they step into marriage with joy, faith, and deep gratitude.`
